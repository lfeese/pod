## Cloudflare tunnel ##
#######################
#
# To use Cloudflare tunnels you must already have a Cloudflare account and it must manage a domain that you own.
#
# Generally the free tier Cloudflare tunnels is suitable for PODs.
# The only downside is that you can not use subdomains.
# So instead of hosts like:
#    pod.oatscenter.org
#    cs.pod.oatscenter.org
#    ssh.pod.oatscenter.org
#    grafana.pod.oatscenter.org
#
# You have to create 4 CNAMEs at the root level, like:
#    pod.oatscenter.org
#    pod-cs.oatscenter.org
#    pod-ssh.oatscenter.org
#    pod-grafana.oatscenter.org
#
# If you really need subdomains, then you need a paid Cloudflare account that supports sub-domains SSL certficiates.
#
######################
# Creating a tunnel ##
######################
#
# First, install the cloudflared tool (https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared).
#
# 1. Login into your Cloudflare account and authorize using the domain with
#
# `cloudflared login`
#
# 2. To create the tunnel, run;
#
# `cloudflared tunnel create <name-of-tunnel>`
#
# 3. Copy the tunnel id from the output under the `tunnel` key
# 4. Copy the contents of the file at ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json under the `cerdentials` key
#
# Optional: remove this entire section if you do not want to use cloudflare tunnels to make the POD accessiable over the Internet
cloudflare:
  # CF tunnel UUID (from `cloudflared tunnel new`)
  tunnel: "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"

  # Cloudflare cerdentials (from ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json after `cloudflared tunnel new`)
  cerdentials: |
    {"AccountTag":"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","TunnelSecret":"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb","TunnelID":"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"}

  # Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of Thingsboard
  # Optional: remove if not using a Thingsboard tunnel
  #thingsboard_fqdn: pod.oatscenter.org

  # Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of Chripstack tunnel
  # Optional: remove if not using a Chripstack tunnel
  #chirpstack_fqdn: pod-cs.oatscenter.org

  # FQDN of grafana tunnel
  # Optional: remove if not using an SSH tunnel
  #grafana_fqdn: pod-grafana.oatscenter.org

  # FQDN of ssh tunnel
  # Optional: remove if not using an SSH tunnel
  #ssh_fqdn: pod-ssh.oatscenter.org
